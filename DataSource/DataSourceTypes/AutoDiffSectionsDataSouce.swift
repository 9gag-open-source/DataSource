/// `DataSource` implementation that has an arbitrary
/// number of sections of items of type T.
///
/// Whenever the array of sections is changed, the dataSource compares
/// each pair of old and new sections via `compareSections` function,
/// and produces minimal set of dataChanges that delete and insert
/// non-matching sections. Then it compares items (via `compareItems` function)
/// within each pair of matching sections and produces minimal sets of dataChanges
/// for non-matching items within those sections.
///
/// `AutoDiffSectionsDataSouce` never generates movement of sections.
/// Items are only compared withing sections, hence movement of items
/// between sections are never found either.
///
/// When comparing sections, `AutoDiffSectionsDataSouce` does not rely
/// on the items they comprise. Instead it calls `compareSections` that
/// you provide it with. Sections are usually compared based on some
/// userData that is used to identify them. Such data can be stored in
/// sections' `supplementaryItems` dictionary under some user-defined key.
